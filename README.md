A giftlist will have multiple gifts, but a gift will only belong to a single wishlist. A gift will have a name(string),
an estimated price(double), a description (string, optional), 
and a link to the site where the gift can be purchased. There 
will also be a boolean indicating whether the gift can be 
purchased on amazon.
